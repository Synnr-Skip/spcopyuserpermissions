spcopyuserpermissions
=====================

SharePoint 2007/2010/2013 PowerShellscript to copy user permissions on all specified sites/subsites

Have you ever had a request for one user to get the same rights on sites and libraries in a SharePoint site as one or two other users, but there are WAY TOO MANY sites, lists and libraries to go through? 

Yes, I know management via AD is recommended, but not everyone does that, and that's how I got involved in the above situation. I needed something to save my headache, so I wrote this bit of code (which came in VERY handy when migrating users in from another domain and consolidating their accounts).
